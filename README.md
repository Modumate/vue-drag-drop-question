# Vue Drag and Drop Test Question Boiler plate

## Instructions

Create a simple app that allows a user to manually drag and drop a list to alphebetically sort the list. When the list is alphebetically sorted, disable dragging and display a success state. This can be as simple as a message indicating success, or confetti! Feel free to be creative with style. The whole repository is yours, edit as much of the boilerplate as you need to.

But don't spend more then 2 hours on the question!
